            Ibuprofen 400 mg BP Tablets, manufactured by Strava Healthcare Private
            Limited, are a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) used for the
            relief of pain, inflammation, and fever. Each tablet contains 400 mg of
            Ibuprofen, the active ingredient known for its analgesic, anti-inflammatory,
            and antipyretic properties.
            <br>
            <br>
            Pain Relief and Inflammation Reduction: Ibuprofen is a well-known NSAID
            that helps alleviate various types of pain, including headaches, dental
            pain, menstrual cramps, muscle aches, and arthritis. It works by inhibiting
            the production of prostaglandins, substances in the body that cause pain,
            inflammation, and fever. Fever Reduction: Ibuprofen 400 mg tablets are
            also effective in reducing fever associated with common illnesses, infections,
            and inflammatory conditions. By reducing fever, they provide relief from
            discomfort and promote a more comfortable state. Trusted Manufacturer:
            Strava Healthcare Private Limited is a reputable pharmaceutical company
            known for its commitment to quality and patient safety. The company follows
            stringent manufacturing practices to ensure the production of reliable
            and effective medications. The Ibuprofen 400 mg BP Tablets are manufactured
            under strict quality control measures to ensure their efficacy.
            <br>
            <br>
            Usage and Dosage: The tablets are designed for oral administration and
            should be taken as directed by a healthcare professional or according to
            the instructions on the packaging. The dosage and frequency of administration
            may vary depending on the individual's age, weight, and the severity of
            the condition. It is important to adhere to the recommended dosage and
            not exceed the maximum daily limit of Ibuprofen.
            <br>
            <br>
            Precautions and Side Effects: Ibuprofen may have potential side effects,
            and it is important to be aware of them before using the medication. Common
            side effects may include gastrointestinal disturbances, such as stomach
            pain, nausea, and indigestion. It is important to consult a healthcare
            professional for guidance and to report any adverse reactions. Individuals
            with certain medical conditions, such as stomach ulcers, asthma, or kidney
            problems, or those taking other medications, should consult their healthcare
            provider before using this product to avoid potential interactions or contraindications.
            <br>
            <br>
            Warnings and Precautions: Ibuprofen should be used with caution and under
            medical supervision in certain populations, including the elderly, individuals
            with liver or kidney impairment, and pregnant or breastfeeding women. It
            is important to read and follow the warnings and precautions provided in
            the packaging and consult a healthcare professional if there are any concerns
            or questions.

            Nitrostat® is a sublingual tablet that is used to treat Angina. Nitrostat
            is a form of nitroglycerin. After the tablet dissolves under your tongue,
            nitroglycerin is released. The nitroglycerin enters your bloodstream and
            helps improve blood flow to your heart.
            <br>
            <br>
            Nitrostat is used to prevent or relieve chest pain caused by angina. Nitrostat
            may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide.
            <br>
            <br>
            Angina is a pain or discomfort that feels like a pressure or squeezing
            in your chest. The pain may also spread to your shoulders, arms, neck,
            jaw, or back. Nitrostat can relieve the pain of angina quickly.

            Composition: Feldene contains as active ingredient piroxicam 10 mg in
            the form of capsules and 20 mg/ml in the form of intramuscular injection
            solution (1ml ampoules).
            <br>
            <br>
            Indications: Feldene is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug indicated
            in a variety of conditions requiring anti-inflammatory and/or analgesic
            action , such as: rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis ,
            osteoarthritis (arthrosis, degenerative diseases of the joints), ankylopoietic
            spondylitis, acute musculoskeletal diseases , gout in the acute phase,
            pain generated by surgery or acute trauma, treatment of primary dysmenorrhea
            in patients aged 12 years and over and relief of fever and pain associated
            with inflammation of the upper respiratory tract.
            <br>
            <br>
            Contraindications: Active peptic ulcer. Feldene should not be administered
            to patients who have previously shown hypersensitivity to the drug. There
            is a possibility of cross-sensitivity with acetylsalicylic acid and other
            non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents. Feldene should not be used in patients
            in whom acetylsalicylic acid or other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
            cause symptoms of asthma, nasal polyposis , angioedema or urticaria .
            <br>
            <br>
            Precautions: Feldene can rarely produce peptic ulcers, perforations and
            gastrointestinal bleeding, in rare cases fatal. Therefore, the administration
            of this drug in patients with a history of upper gastrointestinal diseases
            must be closely supervised. in rare cases, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory
            drugs can produce interstitial nephritis, glomerulitis, papillary necrosis
            and nephrotic syndrome. non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs inhibit the
            synthesis of renal prostaglandins that play a supporting role in maintaining
            renal perfusion in patients with low renal blood flow and blood volume.
            In these patients, the administration of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory
            drugs can precipitate renal decompensation, which is followed by the return
            to the pre-treatment state after stopping the therapy with these drugs.
            Patients at increased risk for such reactions are those with congestive
            heart failure, liver cirrhosis, nephrotic syndrome and manifest renal failure.
            These patients must be carefully monitored during treatment with non-steroidal
            anti-inflammatory agents. Due to possible adverse ophthalmic reactions
            of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, it is recommended that patients
            who experience visual disturbances during treatment with Feldene consult
            an ophthalmologist. When used to relieve pain or inflammation in the upper
            respiratory tract, it should be known that non-steroidal anti-inflammatory
            agents are only a symptomatic treatment. If it is used in these cases,
            an appropriate antibiotic treatment must be taken into account at the same
            time.
            <br>
            <br>
            Side effects: Feldene is generally well tolerated. The most common side
            effects encountered are gastrointestinal, but they usually do not lead
            to discontinuation of treatment. These side effects include stomatitis,
            nausea, anorexia, constipation, abdominal discomfort, flatulence, diarrhea,
            abdominal pain, indigestion. Gastrointestinal bleeding, perforations, ulcerations
            have also been reported with the administration of Feldene (see the chapter
            "Warnings and special precautions"). The objective evaluation of the appearance
            of the gastric mucosa and intestinal blood loss showed that 20 mg of Feldene
            per day, administered as a single or divided dose, is much less irritating
            to the gastrointestinal tract than acetylsalicylic acid. Long-term administration
            of a dose of 30 mg per day or more leads to an increased risk of gastrointestinal
            side effects. Edema was observed in a small percentage of patients, especially
            of the ankles. Effects on the central nervous system have rarely been observed:
            dizziness, headache, drowsiness, insomnia, depression, nervousness, hallucinations,
            mood changes, abnormal dreams, mental confusion, paresthesias and vertigo.
            Blurred vision, palpebral edema, eye irritation have also been reported.
            Routine ophthalmoscopy and slit-lamp examination revealed no ocular changes.
            Tinnitus may occur. Dermal hypersensitivity reactions, usually in the form
            of rash and itching, have been cited. Onycholysis and alopecia were rarely
            mentioned. Also, rarely, they have been associated with the treatment of
            photoallergic reactions. As with other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory
            agents, Lyell's disease and Stevens-Johnson syndrome may occur in rare
            cases. Vesiculobullous reactions were rarely cited.

            <br>
            Composition: One tablet contains propranolol 40 mg and excipients: lactose
            monohydrate Super-Tab, corn starch, povidone K 30, talc, magnesium stearate.
            Pharmacotherapeutic group: beta-blocking agents, non-selective beta-blockers.
            <br>
            <br>
            Therapeutic indications Propranolol 40 mg is indicated in: hypertension;
            prophylaxis of angina pectoris attacks ; long-term treatment after acute
            myocardial infarction; treatment of heart rhythm disorders: sinus tachycardia,
            supraventricular tachyarrhythmias (paroxysmal tachycardia, atrial flutter
            and fibrillation, junctional tachycardia), ventricular arrhythmias (extrasystoles,
            ventricular tachycardia); it is of choice in arrhythmias of sympathoadrenergic
            pathogenesis; pheochromocytoma (in association with alpha-blockers); cardiovascular
            disorders in hyperthyroid patients; hypertrophic cardiomyopathy; migraine;
            essential tremor; states of anxiety due to sympathoadrenergic hyperactivity,
            accompanied by tachycardia, palpitations, tensional oscillations and tremors.
            <br>
            <br>
            Contraindications: hypersensitivity to propranolol or any of the excipients;
            anaphylactic type reactions in the antecedents; bronchial asthma and chronic
            obstructive bronchopneumopathy; therapeutically uncontrolled heart failure;
            cardiogenic shock, marked arterial hypotension; sinus bradycardia ( 50
            beats/min); sinus node disease (including sino-atrial block); atrioventricular
            block of degree II and III; Raynaud s type phenomena and other peripheral
            vasculospastic disorders; children under 6 years of age due to the pharmaceutical
            form.
            <br>
            <br>
            Precautions: In case of symptomatic bradycardia (55 beats/min), the dose
            of propranolol should be reduced. Although treatment with beta-blockers
            reduces the risk of arrhythmias, myocardial ischemia and hypertensive jumps,
            during general anesthesia, the prevention of compensatory sympathoadrenergic
            reactions favors hypotensive accidents during anesthesia. When beta-blocker
            treatment cannot be interrupted (for example in coronary patients), it
            is recommended to protect against vagal predominance by administering atropine;
            general anesthetics that depress the heart will be avoided. It is recommended
            to inform the anesthesiologist if the patient is under treatment with beta-blockers.
            If it is necessary to interrupt this treatment, a break of 48 hours is
            sufficient for the reappearance of the response to catecholamines. The
            risk of anaphylactic reactions must be considered. In case of thyrotoxicosis,
            beta-blockers can mask cardiovascular signs in hyperthyroid patients. Athletes
            should be warned that propranolol and other beta-adrenergic blockers are
            included in the list of doping substances.
            <br>
            <br>
            Interaction: The association with antiarrhythmics (amiodarone, propafenone,
            quinidine, disopyramide) can cause contractility, automatism and conductivity
            disorders by inhibiting compensatory sympathetic mechanisms. Beta-blockers
            reduce sympathetic cardiovascular compensatory reactions in the case of
            association with halogenated anesthetics. Simultaneous administration with
            calcium channel blockers (diltiazem, verapamil) increases the risk of myocardial
            depression; such an association requires great caution and is contraindicated
            in patients with cardiac risk. Propranolol increases the effect of antihypertensive
            drugs; for antihypertensives with central action (methyldopa, clonidine,
            reserpine) increases the bradycardic and conduction slowing effect. Tricyclic
            antidepressants, neuroleptics and baclofen administered simultaneously
            with propranolol increase the risk of orthostatic hypotension. Nonsteroidal
            anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and glucocorticoids decrease the antihypertensive
            effect of propranolol by favoring hydrosaline retention. The association
            with insulin or oral antidiabetics requires blood glucose monitoring (hypoglycemic
            reactions are increased and prolonged, vegetative symptoms of hypoglycemia
            are masked). Treatment with beta-blockers should be stopped, if possible,
            before radiological investigations with iodinated contrast substances due
            to the risk of severe adverse reactions. Cimetidine increases the plasma
            concentration of propranolol by inhibiting its hepatic metabolism, increasing
            the risk of adverse reactions (for example marked bradycardia). Propranolol
            increases the plasma concentration of lidocaine by decreasing its hepatic
            metabolism, increasing the risk of adverse cardiac and neurological reactions
            of lidocaine. Enzyme inducers (for example phenobarbital, rifampicin) decrease
            the plasma concentration of propranolol by accelerating hepatic metabolism,
            diminishing its therapeutic effects. Magnesium, aluminum and calcium compounds
            decrease the digestive absorption of propranolol. An interval of 2-3 hours
            is recommended between the administration of these preparations and propranolol.
            <br>
            <br>
            Special warnings: Treatment with propranolol should not be stopped suddenly
            in patients with ischemic heart disease, because it can lead to serious
            heart rhythm disorders, acute myocardial infarction or sudden death; doses
            are gradually reduced. If necessary, another antianginal drug is introduced
            during this period, to avoid aggravation of angina pectoris. In patients
            with vasculospastic angina (Prinzmetal), propranolol, like other beta-blockers,
            is not the medication of choice. It can be added to other antianginal drugs
            when they are not effective enough. In patients with therapeutically controlled
            heart failure, treatment should be initiated with low doses that can be
            gradually increased under medical supervision. Due to the negative dromotropic
            effect, beta-blockers should be administered with caution in patients with
            first-degree atrioventricular block. In patients with pheochromocytoma,
            alpha-blocker treatment must be instituted before the administration of
            beta-blockers, in order to prevent the risk of increased blood pressure.
            In the elderly, the treatment should be initiated with small doses and
            under careful medical supervision. Caution is recommended in setting doses
            in patients with liver and kidney failure. Diabetes monitoring is recommended;
            certain signs and symptoms that may indicate a hypoglycemic reaction may
            be masked (eg tachycardia, palpitations, sweating). The use of propranolol
            in patients with inadequately controlled diabetes requires caution. Prolonged
            administration of propranolol can cause an increase in triglycerides and,
            to a lesser extent, an increase in plasma cholesterol; the clinical significance
            of the increase in plasma lipids is not specified. When initiating treatment
            with beta-blockers in patients with psoriasis, cases of aggravation of
            the disease during treatment have been observed. In patients with a history
            of severe anaphylactic reactions, especially to iodinated contrast agents,
            as well as those under desensitization treatment, the administration of
            beta-blockers can be an aggravating factor and has an antagonistic effect
            on adrenaline.
            <br>
            <br>
            If beta-blockers are administered to patients with liver cirrhosis and
            digestive bleeding, the blood count, hematocrit and hemoglobinemia must
            be checked periodically.
